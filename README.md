## Project features

- Semantic HTML5

## Plan on improving the project

If I had to prioritize one improvement to make to this project, it would definitely be to make it able to render correctly at any aspect ratio rather than only at a 1400px width. As I learn more during my journey as a TripleTen student, I should learn how to do this soon!

Another key change I have considered is whether or not it could be helpful to make each of the sections listed in the navigation bar display on their own separate tabs. The primary reason for this would be to potentially improve loading time, but if upon testing it I find out the current way loads better I would not implement this.
